# ESP-GMF-Examples

ESP GMF Examples is a component that collects GMF-related examples, mainly designed to help users quickly access GMF examples through [ESP Registry](https://components.espressif.com/). It is a virtual component that cannot be depended on by any component or project, which means you cannot use `idf.py add-dependency "espressif/gmf_examples"`. The examples are listed below:

| Example Name | Description | Main Components | Data Flow |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
